# DiscordBot
This bot was created as a simple tool to automate the process of creating servers and channels in Discord. It can be used by server administrators or anyone who needs to create a new server quickly and easily. The bot is written in Python and uses the discord.py library to interact with the Discord API. It can be customized and extended to include additional features and functionality as needed.

# Features

The bot can create a server and a specified number of text and voice channels with names specified by the user. It can also change its status to "playing with code" to let users know that it is online and ready to receive commands.

# Usage

To use the bot, you will need to have a Discord account and have the necessary permissions to create servers and channels. Here are the steps to follow:

1-    Clone or download the code from this GitHub repository.
2-    Create a new Discord bot on the Discord Developer Portal.
3-    Copy the bot token and paste it into the token variable in the code.
4-    Run the code using a Python interpreter.
5-    In a Discord server, type !create_server followed by the name of the server, the number of text channels, the number of voice channels, and the names of the channels (optional)

# Example :

DiscordBot.py !create_server My Server 2 1 General Voice
